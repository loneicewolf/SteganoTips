Hello hello!
Heh it was a long while ago I begun posting here! First of all, I hope you who reads this is having a nice day! the reply(this one!) might look long but, please stick with it! I have tried my very best to make it easy to read, and dont be afraid to point out any errors/inconsistencies or any questions; we are here to learn!

First off, I have been taking this example from a reddit post! I did subsequently remove my answer to that post because it was a wall of text, and I know how difficult it might be reading those.

# Section 1
to simulate it I created a file, by in Linux 
Check Erratas below, I thought `cat` was okay but it seemed difficult(cuz timing to `CTRL + C` to cancel it), I ran it for 1 second or something and..it became 24MB `0.0` not really easy but.. including it for "historical" purposes like (do Not do as I did here, instead, check the **erratas** section, basically scroll down)
- do not use this: xD `cat /dev/urandom` or `/dev/random` `>> /tmp/myfile` for 0.5s 

And then I basically echoed "HELLO WORLD" (yes!) into the file, then repeated the `cat /dev/` script line, (basically making it in the middle of garbage, being a  few MB in size I think)

I would say if it is simple like this, just use
1. `strings`
2. `foremost` <- mostly used for real forensics like on DISKS and IMAGES_of_DISKS but, eh who knows?? heh
3. `sort` <- for sorting stuff by length, so HELLO WORLD is uh.. 10 (starting from H=0,E=1,...,D(including space)=10) so, BUT OFC we wouldnt know what the length was, but this is where `sort` comes in!

**Extra Help: GPT**
of course you could make*(or ask GPT, or an AI or someone else)* to make a algorithm(`Methodology in human terms`) for you (ofc if you use any help, do be open about that  <- nothing wrong with using others help as long as one is open) ``

## Erratas(fixes/corrections):
- `head -c 1M </dev/urandom >>/tmp/myfile` better to use than to time the command 
- Note I changed `>` to `>>`. (what's the difference? `>` is Not append, it's overwrite, and we want to **in this case** append all steps, 1,2,3 below)

## External Sources
- https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/33634 `the head command`
- https://security.stackexchange.com/a/3939 `why use Urandom instead of /random` <- **I did think one of them was more insecure or Less good but didn;t know exactly how, so, very interesting read! I learned a lot! just by replying :D**


# TLDR
```sh
# head -c 1M </dev/urandom >>/tmp/myfile
# echo "HELLO WORLD" >> /tmp/myfile 
# head -c 1M </dev/urandom >>/tmp/myfile
```

1. heads(takes) the first 1MB of (u)random data into myfile
2. echo's(writes) HELLO WORLD (the phrase you should find) into myfile(after the (u)random data)
3. repeat (1) 

**ofc we wouldn't know HELLO WORLD Here but, to be sure we have a real file to work with we do the below**
```
grea@kurogane:~$ grep HELLO --text /tmp/myfile  | strings | sort --unique 
HELLO WORLD
s)Gy$j;
#~X8
```

# Section 2

- the below oneliner is basically a `CRIB` analyzer
- Basically speaking, you have a CRIB (a `word` you think/know might appear like "YOU FOUND IT" and "SECRET" or "PASSWORD FOUND" or something like that!)
- this script has a list (you can extend it by just adding "word1"**, "word2"**)
    - `{"CRYPTO","HELLO","SECRET","FOUND","PASSWORD","another_word1"};`
- for each WORD in that list, It searches trough it in the file. Now, you could ofc also add stuff to do a `encryption operation` on the word, before you check, like.. if the challenge is to find "HELLO WORLD" but encrypted with Caesar with k=5 for example, it would be tedious to change every single thing(so tedious we wont xD) but, we could make 1 additional script (even python), to make a caesar script, soo, the oneliner would basically 1) still loop trough it, but make another variable say enc_crib=(the output of the execution of caesar_script.sh --key=5 "`$crib`") so it would take all the words, say "CRYPTO" and then caesar it with key=5 (to verify this we can https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher `CRYPTO -> CAESAR(5) -> HWDUYT` (so then we would search for **HWDUYT** In the file, and `yes` you guessed right we can have 2 loops:
Loop_A for the words (discussed above) Loop_B for keys(0..26) for ceasar! or any operation that needs a number (--key=(..)) )

*..A bit long there, sorry! Moving on!*

note this might be tedious but, I assure you: it's probably a lot **less** tedious than going trough 1MB+ in a notepad! (I have to be honest though: it's the ***very first thing I and many other do begin with cuz..sometimes its a big file meant to look difficult, then the phrase "YOU FOUND IT" is very close to either.. `1 the bottom(simple append)` or the beginning `simple append then appending the actual decoy data`

# Section 3 - final script
```
for crib in {"CRYPTO","HELLO","SECRET","FOUND","PASSWORD"}; do sleep 1; (sort /tmp/myfile.strings --unique | grep --ignore-case --color "$crib" && printf "\e[32m[+] $crib FOUND\e[00m" ) ; done
```

# FINAL section - Feedback!
- please give any feedback if you want me to make a script or anything, maybe it would be easier in python.. maybe a gui? or perhaps reading the words from a file..or making/WGett'ing the words from internet, to or from a file, anyway, tell me!
# Thank You For Readings!
do point out if I have written something entirely wrong! 

Finally, Take care!
